## Title

Serverless File Processing System using AWS EC2, S3, and Lambda

## 1. Introduction

This project demonstrates the implementation of a cloud-based system on Amazon Web Services (AWS) without using any traditional database. The solution uses EC2 for hosting a web interface, S3 for storage, and AWS Lambda for backend processing. The objective is to understand how event-driven and serverless services can replace databases for certain applications.

## 2. Problem Statement

To design a cloud system that can:

* Accept files from users
* Store them securely in cloud storage
* Automatically process the files using cloud functions
* Display processed results back to the user

## 3. Services Used

* Amazon EC2 – Hosting the web interface
* Amazon S3 – Storing uploaded files
* AWS Lambda – Processing files without a server
* Amazon VPC – Networking
* IAM & Security Groups – Security and access control

## 4. System Architecture

User → Internet → EC2 (Web Interface) → S3 (File Storage)
↓
Lambda (Auto Processing)

## 5. Implementation Steps

### 5.1 EC2 Setup

An Ubuntu EC2 instance was launched and Apache was installed:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install apache2 -y
```

A simple HTML upload page was hosted on the server.

### 5.2 S3 Bucket Configuration

An S3 bucket was created to store uploaded files. Versioning and public access blocking were enabled.

### 5.3 Lambda Function Setup

A Lambda function was created using Python to automatically process files uploaded to S3 (for example, image resizing or text extraction). The function was triggered using S3 Event Notifications.

### 5.4 IAM Role Configuration

An IAM role was attached to Lambda with permission to read from and write to the S3 bucket.

### 5.5 Application Flow

1. User uploads a file through the web page on EC2.
2. File is stored in S3.
3. S3 event triggers Lambda.
4. Lambda processes the file and saves output back to S3.
5. User can download the processed file.

## 6. Security Measures

* IAM roles instead of access keys
* Private S3 bucket with controlled access
* Security groups with least privilege

## 7. Testing and Results

Files uploaded through the web interface were successfully stored in S3 and processed automatically by the Lambda function. The output files were verified and downloaded.

## 8. Conclusion

This project proves that cloud-native serverless functions can replace traditional databases for event-driven processing tasks. The solution is scalable, cost-effective, and fully managed.

## 9. Future Enhancements

* Add CloudFront for faster file delivery
* Add CloudWatch logs and alarms
* Integrate email notification using SNS
